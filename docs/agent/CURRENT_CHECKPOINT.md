# Current checkpoint

Updated 2026-10-08 by Codex, assigned Primary Builder for DEV-FLOW-002 only.
This is a handoff, not implementation or merge authorization. Read the approved objective brief;
verify branch/PR/head/CI from Git and GitHub rather than assuming this checkpoint is live state.

## Verified starting state

- Fresh `origin/master` and starting checkout both matched
  `9cf48c07b4b4e1ff807983dbc845d06a2de6eedb` with a clean working tree.
- PR [#200](https://github.com/gavinlohnes/neo-beyond-lohnes/pull/200) merged at that SHA;
  both Git history and the public PR page confirm it. The former pending-review pointer is stale.
- PR [#199](https://github.com/gavinlohnes/neo-beyond-lohnes/pull/199) remains the historical
  standalone-activation prerequisite. Its implementation and evidence are preserved.
- PR [#201](https://github.com/gavinlohnes/neo-beyond-lohnes/pull/201) is still open on GitHub;
  this objective does not modify or close it. PR #200 already contains the AutoBackup selector repair.
- `ACTIVE_DROP.md` still records WEEKAHEAD-001 as CLOSED and is untouched historical Factory state.
  It does not assign this adoption objective or authorize VCC-001 implementation.

## DEV-FLOW-002 adoption

- **Authorization / risk:** explicit bounded owner approval, 2026-10-08; PROTECTED governance.
- **Brief:** [`DEV-FLOW-002.md`](DEV-FLOW-002.md), including scope and hard exclusions.
- **Branch:** `codex/dev-flow-002-adoption`. Exact head is derived with `git rev-parse HEAD` and
  will be bound in the PR description/review; do not use a self-referential checkpoint hash.
- **PR:** creation pending GitHub API network access. Requested title:
  `DEV-FLOW-002 — Simplify BEYOND Development Workflow`.
- **Done:** central workflow charter; reconciled procedural instructions; preserved historical
  Drop skill with a supersession notice; Protected governance risk guidance and 25 CLI regression
  cases; VCC-001 procedural transfer retaining all product scope, acceptance evidence, six
  screenshots, and independent exact-head review. State Rail remains unimplemented/unstarted.
- **Local verification:** 206 files passed; 2,129 tests passed, one skipped. Architecture checks,
  TypeScript/production build, syntax and whitespace checks passed. Committed-diff risk guidance
  reports PROTECTED. Consistency checks confirm unchanged product doctrine, VCC scope/invariants/
  acceptance/review, historical skill body, Factory pointer, CI workflows, and dependency files.
  Browser tests used the ignored onboarding config selecting installed `/usr/bin/chromium`;
  no tests, assertions, or tracked browser configuration were bypassed or weakened.
- **Remaining:** open the adoption PR, confirm exact-head required PR Verification, obtain independent
  Protected review, and wait for Gavin's merge approval. No PR merge is authorized in this session.
- **Blocker:** `api.github.com` requests return Forbidden under the current egress policy. Existing
  `GH_TOKEN` binding is present; no new token was requested. Git fetch and public GitHub pages work.
  The cloud environment draft adds only `api.github.com` to custom allowed domains, preserving
  package-manager presets and setup instructions; saving the draft does not apply it to this machine.
- **Next action:** apply the proposed API access through environment settings, retry read-only
  GitHub API access, create the PR from the pushed branch with the prepared description, record its
  URL in GitHub, and confirm required CI on the exact head. Do not modify PR #201, start VCC-001,
  activate Factory Phase 2, or integrate anything.
- **Authority conflicts:** none unresolved within the approved adoption scope. Historical procedure
  is explicitly superseded for new work only after this adoption merges with owner approval.

## DECISIONS FOR GAVIN

No product decision needed. GitHub API egress must be enabled to finish PR creation and CI validation.
